<brand name="unikname"/> users are automatically signed in for an optimal user experience.

## Discourse plugin installation

- Connect to your Discourse server (sorry, you can't install a plugin from the admin panel 😞)
- Access your container’s `app.yml` file (it should be present in `/var/discourse/containers/`)

    cd /var/discourse
    nano containers/app.yml

Add the Discourse Unikname Connect plugin’s repository URL to your container’s `app.yml` file:

```
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - ...
          - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/unik-name/discourse-unikname
```

(Add the plugin’s `git clone` url just below `sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git`)

Rebuild the container:

    cd /var/discourse
    ./launcher rebuild app

That’s it, you’ve successfully installed the Unikname Connect plugin on your Discourse instance!

## Discourse setup

A an admin, go to the Discourse "burger" menu → admin → "Settings" tab → "Plugin" category.

You can also go to `https://<your_discourse_forum_url>` `/admin/site_settings/category/plugins?filter=plugin%3Adiscourse-unikname`

Then, configure the following attributes:

| Attribut | Description |
|--------|-----------|

| `unikname connect unikname key` | The key you have received from Unikname's support request |
| `unikname connect secret` | The secret you have received from Unikname's support request |
| `unikname connect authorize scope` | `openid` by default, or `openid email` if you want to ask for the user to share his email address |

Your users should now be able to use <brand name="UNC"/> to connect to your website and to see this kind of login screen:
