## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having issues when connecting (access denied ...), check that the credentials (the @unikname of your organization, Unikname Connect secret, client id/secret ...) you are using to connect to <brand name="UNC"/> authentication server are the good one.

### When connecting, my users are stuck at https://mydomain.com/?OIDCCallback=UniknameConnect&code=...

This situation might have several origins.

#### Wrong plugin configuration

Check again that the credentials you are using to connect to Unikname Connect authentication server are the good one, provided by Unikname Support:
- Unikname Connect site id
- Unikname Connect secret

#### TLS error with fsockopen

Some WordPress administrators have reported weird interactions between our TLS Let's Encrypt certificate and WordPress installations with `fsockopen` on PHP 7.3.

Example of errors you might see in your WordPress `debug.log` file ([if enabled](https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/#wp_debug_log)):

```
SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages:
error:14094458:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 unrecognized name
stream_socket_client(): Failed to enable crypto
stream_socket_client(): unable to connect to ssl://connect.unikname.com:443 (Unknown error)
```

In this case, you need to install `php-curl` on your server, which works fine.

### Compatibility with WP-Cerber plugin

If you are a user of the feature "Custom login URL" feature of WP-Cerber plugin, you need also to enable the "deferred rendering" option to display the Unikname Connect button within the renamed login page.

See this option in the WP-Cerber plugin settings: [https://wpcerber.com/user-switching-with-wp-cerber/](https://wpcerber.com/user-switching-with-wp-cerber/)
