:::warning About the retention period

The getter of a UniknameID remains the owner of his identifier for no limit of time, provided that the identifier has been activated and that it is used regularly.

The retention period is the period which guarantees the getter of a UniknameID that he remains the owner of his identifier if it has not been activated or if it is not used regularly. 

Once the retention period has passed, the acquirer of a Unikname ID remains the owner as long as another person does not want to acquire it. If another person get it after the retention period, then the  UniknameID is fully reset and it looses all its previous access.
