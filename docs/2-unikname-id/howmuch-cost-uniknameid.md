# How much does it cost to get a PREMIUM UniknameID?

All UniknameIDs shorter than 15 characters are PREMIUM ones and have to be paid. 

The shorter a name, the rarer it is, the more expensive it is. There will be one and only one <un id="@bob"/>. :-) 

All PREMIUM UniknameIDs have the following specifications: 
- PREMIUM ID can have a public registry with up to 100 properties. 
- PREMIUM ID receive a welcome reward of 100 UNIK tokens at activation time.

The getter of a PREMIUM UniknameID remains the owner of his identifier for no limit of time, provided that the identifier has been activated within 4 weeks and it used regularly*. So it is recommended to activate it as soon as you get it.
