# What is Safetypo?

The UniknameIDentifiers are based on the SafeTypo© technology. 

The SafeTypo© technology builds trustworthy Human-Readable identifiers that cannot be counterfeit. They're easily readable, spellable and communicable safely regarding spoofing, typosquatting risks and phishing hacks.

Why?

The SafeTypo© technology prevents users from creating similar and confusing identifiers. No errors due to confusing characters, accents, homonyms, hseparators or not, character inversion, international charset…

Nobody can create a UniknameIDentifier that closely resemble your own or with misstyped variations to trick you when you login on a website.

**Example:**
Your @unikname is @cecile.
Safetypo technology prevents other users to create a @unikname similar to yours, with:
- upper-case (@Cecile), 
- with accents (@cécile)
- with other characters (@cec-ile, @cec1le).

If you can't create a UniknameIDentifier refer to our Safetypo Alphabet.
